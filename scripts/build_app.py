"""Freeze Vaultkeeper and package it for whichever OS you are on.

    python scripts/build_app.py            # freeze + package
    python scripts/build_app.py --no-package   # freeze only
    python scripts/build_app.py --clean        # start from nothing

A PySide6 app cannot be cross-built: the freeze embeds a Python interpreter and
Qt's native libraries for the machine it runs on. So this makes the artifact for
*this* platform, and the other two are produced by CI on their own runners. That
extends to CPU architecture — PySide6 has per-arch wheels, so an Apple Silicon
build is arm64-only and an Intel Mac needs its own. The names say which.

    macOS     dist/Vaultkeeper.app  ->  dist/vaultkeeper-<ver>-macos-<arch>.dmg
    Windows   dist/vaultkeeper/     ->  an Inno Setup .exe (see CI)
    Linux     dist/vaultkeeper/     ->  .tar.gz (AppImage in CI)

The bundle carries the save editor (a dependency, so freezing picks it up), this
platform's 7-Zip, and the UI image set. Only the current platform's 7-Zip goes
in: shipping all four would waste 9 MB of a download for binaries that cannot run.

Nothing here is signed. Unsigned, macOS Gatekeeper asks the user to right-click
→ Open the first time, and Windows SmartScreen warns; both are expected. The
hooks for signing are marked in the spec.
