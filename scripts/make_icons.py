"""Render the application icon at every size an installer needs.

The artwork is SVG, under ``assets/icons/source``, and it comes in three builds
rather than one. That is the whole point: a single drawing scaled to 16px turns
to mush, so the designer authored a full-detail mark plus reduced ones for the
small sizes, and this renders each size from the build meant for it.

    full detail   >= 64px
    vaultkeeper-48   48px only
    vaultkeeper-32   32px and 16px

What each build drops is recorded in ``assets/icons/source/DESIGN.txt``.

    python scripts/make_icons.py            # writes assets/icons/

Outputs the PNG ladder plus the two formats the installers need: a multi-size
``.ico`` for Windows, and (on macOS) an ``.icns`` via ``iconutil``.
