# Run the pure-Python tests against a real Windows Python, from macOS, using a
# CrossOver bottle.
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# The suite ran green on macOS for months while `is_network_path` was broken on
# Windows, because a test cannot catch a host assumption it shares. CI on a
# Windows runner does catch those, but it costs a push and several minutes, and
# it only reports after the fact.
#
# This gives the same signal in about five seconds. What it reproduces is real,
# not mocked:
#
#   * os.name == "nt", sys.platform == "win32"
#   * cp1252 as the locale encoding, which is where read_text() without an
#     explicit encoding blows up
#   * ntpath as the path flavour: drive letters, backslash separators, and the
#     fact that Path() normalises a POSIX-looking path into a backslashed one
#   * Windows filename rules (no ':' in a name) and symlink privilege
#
# It found a real bug the macOS suite structurally could not: is_network_path
# handled a network path given as a *string* but not as a *Path*, because only
# on Windows do those two stringify differently.
#
# What it does NOT reproduce
# --------------------------
# Wine is not Windows. File locking, ACLs and genuine Win32 API edge cases
# differ, and case sensitivity here comes from the host filesystem (APFS is
# case-insensitive by default, which happens to match Windows -- by luck, not by
# emulation).
#
# So this is a third data point that is cheap enough to run every time. It does
# not replace the Windows CI job.
#
# The default run skips the Qt tests, for speed rather than capability: Qt does
# load under Wine, with its real "windows" platform plugin, and both full suites
# pass there. Point pytest at the whole tests directory if you want them, or use
# --shot, which is the part of the UI a headless assertion cannot check anyway.
#
# Usage
# -----
#   scripts/win_test.sh --setup        # once: create the bottle, install Python
#   scripts/win_test.sh                # run this repo's non-Qt tests
#   scripts/win_test.sh -k some_test   # extra args go to pytest
#   scripts/win_test.sh --shot         # render the main window as Windows draws it
#
# --setup also installs PySide6, which is what makes --shot (and the Qt tests,
# if you point pytest at them) possible: Qt loads under Wine with its native
# "windows" platform plugin, so the PNG shows genuine Windows text metrics.
