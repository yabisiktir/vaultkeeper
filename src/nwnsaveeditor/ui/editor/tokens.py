"""Design tokens for the Save Game Editor.

The dark set is the one from ``docs/design_handoff_save_editor/README.md``
("Design Tokens"), which authors colour in OKLCH. Qt stylesheets have no
``oklch()``, so each value is converted to sRGB hex once, here, and referenced by
name everywhere else — the handoff's OKLCH source is kept in the comment beside
each token so it can be re-derived if the design moves.

The editor also offers a **light** set. It is not a second design: it is the same
layout lit from the other side, anchored on the application palette in
:mod:`vaultkeeper.ui.theme` (window ``#f0f0f0``, base ``#ffffff``, near-black
text) so the editor sits beside the rest of Vaultkeeper, warmed a few points
towards the design's brown hue and with the gold accent darkened until it carries
text on a white surface.

Colour tokens are *not* module constants: they live in :data:`DARK` / :data:`LIGHT`
and are served from the active palette through :pep:`562`'s module ``__getattr__``.
Every call site keeps reading ``t.APP_BG``, and :func:`set_theme` swaps the whole
set live. Geometry and typography do not change with the theme, so those stay
plain constants.

Anything that bakes a token into a module-level string would freeze the theme it
was imported under, which is why the editor's shared stylesheets (``widgets``,
the screens' tree/input QSS) are all built by functions rather than assigned once.
